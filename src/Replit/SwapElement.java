    Finish the method called swap() that will take an ArrayList<String> argument list and two int numbers pos1 and pos2. The method returns an ArrayList<String> which has the elements at indexes pos1 and pos2swapped. Swapping means they will change positions in the ArrayList and all other elements will remain untouched. Theswap()` method is already called in the main method with an argument.
        This is a return method with an ArrayList<String> parameter
        Main topics: methods, Scanner, ArrayList

        Example:

        swap(["one","two","three"],0,2);
        output:
        ["three","two","one"]

        Example:

        swap(["a","c","b","d","e"],0,3);
        output:
        ["d","c","b","a","e"]*/
