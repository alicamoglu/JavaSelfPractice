/*
    2. Create a class named NumberOfDays. An integer variable named month is given
        Use switch statement to write a program that can find the number of days in the given number of month.

        EX:
        month = 5

        output:
        31 days

        (Assume that February has 28 days)

        Hints:
        Months that has 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
        Months that has 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
